Python Project: Number Guessing

About:
Number Guessing is a very interesting and fun game among a lot of people. 
The computer will randomly select a number from a range of numbers provided by the user.
The user will also provide how many chances they need to guess the number.
As the user is attempting to guess the number, the computer will indicate whether the number guessed is greater than, less than, or equal to the number selected by the computer.
If the user runs out of chances, it will let them know that the game is over and it will reveal the number selected.
